# Machine Learning Breath

I created this repository to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch, and compare them with the
state of the art machine learning frameworks, such as Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, and Pytorch.

## Roadmap
This repo presents the following machine learning models.
- [Linear Regression](linear_regression)
- [Logistic Regression](logistic_regression)
- Neural Network
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K Means
